## An easy application that asks a server for a time and prints it

To try it yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vlad1k337/time-sending-sockets
cd src 
make
```
### Daytime service 
If you using daytime service, than port 13 is occupied by Daytime Service Protocol. 
So, any attempts to start the server will fail, but you can start the client, and it should print the date for ya!
